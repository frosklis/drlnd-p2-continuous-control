# Continuous control

This is the last project from Udacity's deep learning nano degree where we have a robotic arm that we want to control. There is another version where there are 20 of such robotic arms

## To run this code

First create a python environment with python 3.6 and install the requirements from the requirements file. If using conda:

```bash
conda install -n myenv python=3.6
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need jupyter notebook, install it if not already in your system. And make sure you add the environment you created to it.

```
conda install ipykernel
````

In order to install the environments, there is a makefile in the *extras* folder.

Enjoy!
